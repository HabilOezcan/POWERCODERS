                    <p> Cumulus clouds are the clouds you learned to draw at an early age and that serve as the symbol
                        of all clouds (much like the snowflake symbolizes winter). Their tops are rounded, puffy, and a
                        brilliant white when sunlit, while their bottoms are flat and relatively dark.
                        <br>Cumulus clouds develop on clear, sunny days when the sun heats the ground directly below
                        (diurnal convection). This is where they get their nickname of "fair weather" clouds. They
                        appear in the late morning, grow, and then disappear toward evening.</p>

                        <br>CStratus clouds are seen on dreary, overcast days and are associated with light mist or
                        drizzle.

                <div class="information">
                    <p> If you took an imaginary knife and spread cumulus clouds together across the sky but not into a
                        smooth layer (like stratus), you'd get stratocumulus—these are low, puffy, grayish or whitish
                        clouds that occur in patches with blue sky visible in between. When viewed from underneath,
                        stratocumulus have a dark, honeycomb appearance.
                        <br>You're likely to see stratocumulus on mostly cloudy days. They form when there's weak
                        convection in the atmosphere.</p>

                <div class="information">
                    <p> Altocumulus clouds are the most common clouds in the middle atmosphere. You'll recognize them as
                        white or gray patches that dot the sky in large, rounded masses or clouds that are aligned in
                        parallel bands. They look like the wool of sheep or scales of mackerel fish—hence their
                        nicknames "sheep backs" and "mackerel skies."<br>Altocumulus and stratocumulus are often mistaken. Besides
                        altocumulus being higher up in the sky, another way to tell them apart is by the size of their
                        individual cloud mounds. Place your hand up to the sky and in the direction of the cloud; if the
                        mound is the size of your thumb, it's altocumulus. (If it's closer to fist-size, it's probably
                        stratocumulus.)<br>Altocumulus are often spotted on warm and humid mornings, especially during
                        summer. They can signal thunderstorms to come later in the day. You may also see them out ahead
                        of cold fronts, in which case they signal the onset of cooler temperatures.</p>

                    <p> Nimbostratus clouds cover the sky in a dark gray layer. They can extend from the low and middle
                        layers of the atmosphere and are thick enough to blot out the sun.
                        <br>Nimbostratus are the quintessential rain cloud. You'll see them whenever steady rain or snow
                        is falling (or is forecast to fall) over a widespread area.</p>

                <div class="information">
                    <p> Altostratus appear as gray or bluish-gray sheets of cloud that partially or totally cover the
                        sky at mid-levels. Even though they cover the sky, you can typically still see the sun as a dimly lit
                        disk behind them, but not enough light shines through to cast shadows on the ground.
                        <br>Altostratus tend to form ahead of a warm or occluded front. They can also occur together
                        with cumulus at a cold front. </p>

                <div class="information">
                    <p> Like their name suggests (which is Latin for "curl of hair"), cirrus are thin, white, wispy
                        strands of clouds that streak across the sky. Because cirrus clouds appear above 20,000 feet (6,096
                        m)—an altitude where low temperatures and low water vapor exist—they are made up of tiny ice crystals
                        rather than water droplets. <br>Cirrus typically occur in fair weather. They can also form out ahead of warm fronts and
                        large-scale storms like nor'easters and tropical cyclones, so seeing them can also indicate
                        storms may be coming. <br>NASA's Earthdata site quotes a proverb that sailors learned to warn them of coming rainy
                        weather, “Mares’ tails (cirrus) and mackerel scales (altocumulus) make lofty ships to carry low
                        sails.”</p>

                <div class="information">
                    <p> Cirrocumulus clouds are small, white patches of clouds often arranged in rows that live at high
                        altitudes and are made of ice crystals. Called "cloudlets," the individual cloud mounds of
                        cirrocumulus are much smaller than that of altocumulus and stratocumulus and often look like
                        grains. <br>CCirrocumulus clouds are rare and relatively short-lived, but you'll see them in winter or
                        when it's cold but fair.</p>

                <div class="information">
                    <p> Cirrostratus clouds are transparent, whitish clouds that veil or cover nearly the entire sky. A
                        dead giveaway to distinguishing cirrostratus is to look for a "halo" (a ring or circle of light)
                        around the sun or moon. The halo is formed by the refraction of the light on the ice crystals in the
                        clouds, similarly to how sundogs form but in an entire circle rather than just on either side of
                        the sun.
                        <br>Cirrostratus indicate that a large amount of moisture is present in the upper atmosphere.
                        They're also generally associated with approaching warm fronts.</p>

                    <p> Cumulonimbus clouds are one of the few clouds that span the low, middle, and high layers. They
                        resemble the cumulus clouds from which they grow, except they rise into towers with bulging
                        upper portions that look like cauliflower. Cumulonimbus cloud tops are usually always flattened in the
                        shape of an anvil or plume. Their bottoms are often hazy and dark.
                        <br>Cumulonimbus clouds are thunderstorm clouds, so if you see one you can be sure there's a
                        nearby threat of severe weather (short but heavy periods of rainfall, hail, and possibly even
